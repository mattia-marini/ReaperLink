# ReaperLink
~~Simple~~ Not so simple lua script to link fx parameters across different tracks in reaper. 

## Installation
Install like any other script. The only note is that you should put the `__startup.lua` file in the script folder if you want the background syncing task to automatically start on reaper lanuch

1. Put `Marini_ReaLink_Background.lua` and `Marini_ReaLink_Ui_Toggle.lua` wherever you want (script folder or subdirectory)
2. Put `__startup.lua` <b>in the script folder</b>, inside the reaper resource path (<i>Options -> Show REAPER resource path in explorer/finder...</i>)
3. Add the scripts in reaper (<i>Actions -> Show action list...</i>)
4. Restart Reaper and you are now ready to go! You should use the `Marini_ReaLink_Ui_Toggle.lua` command to show/hide the plugin GUI, either through shortcut or putting it in a toolbar
